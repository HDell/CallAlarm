MODEL:
    This class will serve as an abstraction of the contact list data that is pulled from the phone.
    Ultimately the data will be formatted as such:

    [
        ("Call ID", "FirstName", "LastName", "Length of call", "Data of call", "Time of call", "Incoming vs. Outgoing"),
        ("Call ID", "FirstName", "LastName", "Length of call", "Data of call", "Time of call", "Incoming vs. Outgoing"),
        ...,
    ]
